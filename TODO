need to make sure that hidden blocks and schemas do not appear anywhere.
Even though it breaks the dependencies between content, is is probably better.

Add visible checkbox for schemas

Adapt search not to show inivisible or removed stuff (maybe already works)

Do not show hidden or removed blocks in schemaEditor
and hidden or removed schemas in subject editor
