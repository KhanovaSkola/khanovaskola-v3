Wacom plugin (javascript api) is distributed with official drivers but not installed by default. Install `Program Files\TabletPlugins`. This will only work for IE and presumably Firefox. Chrome 42+ removed support for plugins. To enable it in Chrome, open about://flags and enable NPAPI. Open the video editor. When prompted, allow the Wacom plugin.

Turns out Chrome probably limits number of events the plugin can receive, making it ill suited for recording smooth videos. IE11 works great.
